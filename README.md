Working minimal C++ examples for using CMake to compile snippets with libraries: 
* Eigen3, 
* OpenMP, 
* MPI and 
* HDF5.

## System
The following examples have been tested on 
* MacOS: 
  * Catalina 10.15.3 with CMAKE 3.17.2, 
  * using only packages from Homebrew 2.2.14.
* Linux: 
  * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with CMAKE 3.10.2, 
  * using only packages from apt-get 1.6.11.
